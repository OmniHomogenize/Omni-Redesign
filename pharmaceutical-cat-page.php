            <p class="bold">The Omni Bead Ruptor family of bead mill homogenizers uses bead tubes that are optimized for soil processing
                to rapidly disrupt soil samples and liberate microbial DNA on up to 24 samples in a single cycle. The resulting
                DNA is of high quality and purity for downstream PCR and qPCR amplification.</p>

            <p>There is increasing evidence that microbes living in soil (soil microbiome) have a tremendous impact on soil
                quality and subsequent ability to produce crops.</p>
            <p>The bacterial taxa found in soil are also present on the plant surface including roots and plant organs so there
                is a tremendous interest in better understanding the soil microbiome and how the microbiome impacts plant
                health, taste and growth rate.</p>
