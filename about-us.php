                                    <p>Omni International, Inc, with headquarters in Kennesaw Georgia, is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of laboratory homogenizers. Omni sets the industry standard with an unmatched commitment to outstanding product design, reliable performance and a uniquely diversified solution based product line.</p>
                                    <p>Since 1956, the name Omni has been synonymous with laboratory homogenizers. Referenced in over 10,000 peer reviewed scientific  articles, Omni International homogenizers can be found in laboratories worldwide and are counted on for years of trouble-free operation. Omni products are designed and built in the United States under ISO 9001 Quality Management Standards.</p>

                                    <p>Since 1956, with the debut of the Omni Mixer, the name Omni has been synonymous with laboratory homogenizers. In 1985, Omni International’s founder, Karl Jahn, a former engineering and marketing manager for Dupont Corporation, purchased the Omni Mixer from Dupont with the vision to create a company focused on innovating homogenization technology. Karl Jahn continues to serve as President of Omni International with an entrepreneurial spirit that has taken Omni from its early roots in rotor-stator technology to the largest homogenizer manufacturer in the United States.</p>
                                    <p>Over the years Omni International has grown to manufacture a broad range on laboratory homogenizers. In 1992, Omni introduced the first disposable generator probe, the Omni TipTM, allowing scientist, for the first time to eliminate cross contamination during the homogenization process. Omni’s innovations in rotor-stator homogenization technology have also included the development of the first battery operated and programmable laboratory homogenizers.</p>

                                    <p>In 2010, Omni launched two groundbreaking homogenizer technologies. The Bead Ruptor 24 bead mill homogenizer gave scientists the ability to rapidly homogenize the most challenging samples including bone, skin and hair.  Building on its predecessor, the Omni Prep, the Liquid Handling and Homogenizer Workstation LH96 allowed laboratories to automate the tedious task of sample weighing, liquid handling, and homogenization.</p>
                                    <p>Today, Omni International homogenizers are used in research institutions, pharmaceutical and contract labs and biotechnology organizations worldwide. The company’s dedication to making homogenizing easy and offering unparalleled support is ever-present as it continues to innovate in an effort to advance scientific research.</p>
